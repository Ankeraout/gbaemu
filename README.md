# GBAEmu
GBAEmu is a GameBoy Advance emulator written in C++ by @Ankeraout.

## Supported platforms
One of the goals of this project is portability.
Here are the supported platforms:

- PC:
    - Windows (x86/x64) : Planned
    - Linux (x86/x64) : Supported
    - Mac OS X : Probably working, untested

## Dependencies
For now this project has no dependencies as the front-end is not even started, but it will probably need a library such as [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) or [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui).
